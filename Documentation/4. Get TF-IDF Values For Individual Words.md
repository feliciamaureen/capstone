#4. Processing Tokenized Words

The script ```words.py``` will allow you to get the word frequency as well as TF-IDF values of the Eurovision and charting songs lyrics.

The following explains how to use ```words.py```.

To run this script you will need to have the lyrics obtained using the get methods in ```preprocess.py```. In addition, you will need the Pandas and Math libraries installed. 

The following explains how to use ```words.py```.

## words.py
This file will take the words from ```preprocess.py``` and calculate the number of times a word occurs. It will also rank the importance of the words using the TF-IDF formulae methods in this script. The results will be stored in Pandas dataframes and be exported as Excel files.

Example usage: 
> $ python words.py
There is no output from this script, as to obtain the Excel files you need to run ```results.py```. However if you would like to only obtain the results from this script, you can add a driver method to call the export methods.
