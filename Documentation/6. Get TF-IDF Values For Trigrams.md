#6. Processing Trigrams

The script ```trigrams.py``` will allow you to get the word frequency as well as TF-IDF values of the Eurovision and charting songs lyrics.

The following explains how to use ```trigrams.py```.

To run this script you will need to have the lyrics obtained using the get methods in ```preprocess.py``` and the TF-IDF calculation methods from ```words.py```. In addition, you will need the Pandas and NLTK libraries installed. As well as any libraries detailed in ```words.py```

The following explains how to use ```trigrams.py```.

## words.py
This file will take the words from ```trigrams.py``` and make trigrams from them using NLTK. It will then calculate the number of times a trigram occurs. It will also rank the importance of the trigram using the TF-IDF formulae methods in this script. The results will be stored in Pandas dataframes and be exported as Excel files.

Example usage: 
> $ python trigrams.py
There is no output from this script, as to obtain the Excel files you need to run ```trigrams.py```. However if you would like to only obtain the results from this script, you can add a driver method to call the export methods.
