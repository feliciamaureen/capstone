#2. Get English Eurovision Lyrics

The script ```compare.py``` will allow you to obtain the lyrics of English lyyrics from Eurovision songs.

The following explains how to use ```compare.py```.

To run this script you will need to have ```eurovision-en.txt``` and ```eurovision-full.txt``` as these files are what we are getting the intersection of to get the English lyrics. 

The following explains how to use ```compare.py```.

## compare.py
```eurovision-en.txt``` contains all the lyrics of the Eurovision songs, with the non-English lyrics translated to English 
```eurovision-full.txt``` contains all the lyrics of the Eurovision songs, untranslated.
This script will read both files line by line and copy the lines that exist in both files into a new text file.

This will use ```eurovision-en.txt``` and ```eurovision-full.txt``` and output a text file with the English lyrics.
