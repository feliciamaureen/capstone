#3. Preparing and Cleaning Data

The script ```preprocess.py``` will allow you to clean and prepre the lyric data before analysis.

To run this script you will need to have the text files containing the lyrics you want to clean. In this case, it would be the Eurovision lyrics as well as all the decades lyrics. 

In addition, you will need the Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, and Regex libraries installed. 

The following explains how to use ```preprocess.py```.

## preprocess.py
Each text file will go through all the cleaning methods, and in the end they will be tokenized into individual words. The cleaned lyrics and tokenized words will be made available to the other classess using a get method for each set of lyrics or words.

Example usage: 
> $ python preprocess.py
This will clean all the text files used as input, and instead of an output all the cleaned text and the tokenized version of the text will be made available to the other classes using get methods.
